        <p>
          Autism, or Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), is a developmental
          disorder that affects communication and behavior. It is a spectrum
          condition, meaning that individuals with autism can have a wide range
          of strengths, challenges, and abilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Characteristics of autism may include difficulties in social
          interaction, repetitive behaviors, and challenges in verbal and
          nonverbal communication. It's important to note that each individual
          with autism is unique, and their experiences can vary widely.

        <p>
          Providing support and understanding for individuals with autism is
          crucial. Families, educators, and communities play key roles in
