      <h2>Understanding the Autism Spectrum</h2>
      <p>
        The Autism Spectrum is a range of conditions characterized by
        challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, and communication
        differences. It is often referred to as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
        due to the wide variation in the type and severity of symptoms among
        individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
        The spectrum includes conditions such as autism, Aspergerâ€™s syndrome,
        and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS).
        Each person with ASD is unique and may display distinct strengths,
        challenges, and abilities.
